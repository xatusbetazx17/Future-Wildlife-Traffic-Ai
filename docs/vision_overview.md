# Vision Overview

We propose a roadside system that detects wildlife, adapts signals, and broadcasts warnings to vehicles. Future extensions add **nonâ€‘invasive health insights** to flag potential zoonotic risks for early response.

Key Pillars:
1) **Detection:** AI model at the edge (YOLO), privacy-preserving, weather-robust.
2) **Decisioning:** Traffic controller with `ANIMAL_CROSSING` and emergency priority.
3) **Comms:** MQTT/UDP V2X-style events to cars & dashboards.
4) **Governance:** Ethics, privacy, safety first.
